    <p>   <h2>Description</h2> </p> 
    This is a very easy recipe that I learned when I was living in England. Note that Beef Wellington should always be served with the center slightly pink. Enjoy!
    p>   <h2>Ingredients</h2> </p> 
<o1>
<li> 2 ½ pounds beef tenderloin  </li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, softened  </li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter   </li>
<li>1 onion, chopped  </li>
<li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms  </li>
<li>2 ounces liver pate )</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, softened </li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste </li>
<li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed </li>
<li>1 egg yolk, beaten  </li>
<li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth  </li>
<li>2 tablespoons red wine  </li>
</o1>

<p>   <h2>How to Make it</h2> </p>    

<strong>Step 1</strong>
<p>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a small baking dish, and spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until browned. Remove from pan, and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.</p>            
<strong>
    Step 2</strong> 

<p>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool.</p>
<strong>Step 3</strong> 
<p>
    Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter, and season with salt and pepper. Spread pate over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
</p>
<strong>Step 4</strong> 
<p>
    Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in the center. Fold up, and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of the dough, and brush with egg yolk.
<strong>Step 5</strong> 
<p>
    Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown. Set aside, and keep warm.
</p>
<strong>Step 6</strong> 

<p>
    Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef stock and red wine; boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, and serve with beef.
